- They are anti-synergy with other cards (i.e. recommended to have 3-5 cards in a supply)
- The additional potion cost complicate the game in many aspects, not just for buys

Alchemy: Herbalist
- Need ordering of cleanup discarding
- Alternating other cards halfway through their movement

Promo: Stash
